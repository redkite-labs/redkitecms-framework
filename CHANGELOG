RedKite CMS Framework Alpha 1 (2015/05/11)
4834689 changed how tinymce editor is closed by adding a button to tinymce toolbar which closes it; removed the double click action used to close the editor
86c2d43 fixed move which did not work when adding a new block and immediately move it
7f279d5 removed BlockManager instantiation in actions and delegated BlockManagerFactory to instantiate objects
6ef1f75 added BlockManagerFactory to instantiate a new BlockManager object
40be305 changed how blocks history works. Before this change each block was saved in a single file and that slowed the application because
        RedKite CMS must open several files for each block every time the page is opened. Now history is saved in a single file so page is
        opened faster. In production the history restoring process is now skipped because is not required.
